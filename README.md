### GME (Green Metropolis Enthusiast) 
Mobile application prototype designed for a proposed E-Waste management ecosystem, built using React Native, Expo, and Firebase.

### Key Features:

- **User authentication**: This includes login, registration, and logout functionality. The app uses Firebase Authentication and supports email/password login as well as Google sign-in.
- **User profiles**: Each user has a profile stored in Firestore that contains information such as their accumulated reward points.
- **Deposit history**: Users can view their deposit history, which is stored in Firestore. The history includes information such as the recycled object, the location of the deposit, and the reward points earned for each deposit.
- **Deposit functionality**: Users can deposit e-waste at designated drop-off points. Each deposit is recorded in Firestore, and the user's reward points are updated accordingly.
- **Image uploading**: Users can upload images (presumably of the items they are recycling). The app uses Firebase Storage to store these images and Expo's ImagePicker to allow users to select images from their device.
